# Freya-Firebase-Rat-Properties
Features for the new upcoming Firebase rat.

Why Firebase?

Because using Google Firebase is extremely easy and does not require a port. On top of that, it allows us to do almost anything.

How will I use it?

A video on how to install will be coming soon when the rat is released. By the way, another rat using IP - PORT is on the way.
